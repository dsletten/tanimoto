1. Without direct access to another "mind" we can only assess its intelligence by means of its behavior.
   Can it answer difficult questions? Can it learn? Can it explain how it reached a given conclusion?

My personal expression of intelligence growing up involved:
- Learning (quicker than other kids)
  - Memory
- Reasoning (correctly applying valid rules) Logic puzzles, geometry proofs
- Creativity (inventing/discovering solutions not evident to others)
  - Intuition?
  - Analogy
- Interest in intellectual activities
- Concentration/focus
- Pattern recognition

2. a. People suffer from a lack of imagination combined with fear of the unknown. All of their lives,
      they have encountered intelligence exhibited by other humans, and if they have paid attention,
      in animals as well. But the average person views a computer as a mechanical device somewhat more
      complicated than a washing machine. They cannot imagine a washing machine exhibiting intelligence
      (again they are not paying attention!) and likewise struggle to imagine an intelligent computer
      either.
   b. Human hubris views our kind as the pinnacle of "creation", made in "God's" own image. They can
      not imagine a purely physical system demonstrating intelligence at the level of a human, or
      heaven forbid being surpassed by such an entity.

3. a. Human memories are fragile and easily distorted.
   b. Human senses are frail. We are unable to perceive very fast events or make fine-grained distinctions
      among perceptions (pitch, color). We also suffer from optical illusions.
   c. Humans routinely make reasoning errors often influenced by emotion and preconceptions. (Influenced
      by evolution? Survival advantages for seeing patterns where they don't really exist?)
   d. Poor introspection.

   a. Current digital computers lack the massively parallel connections of the human brain.
   b. AI is still a relatively young field compared to other scientific/engineering disciplines.
   c. Limitations of current theories of intelligence.

4. a. Monitor household supplies.
   b. Assist in scheduling events.
   c. Manage househould environment to optimize energy efficiency.
   d. 2024 Alexa. Play music, dim lights, look up information.

5. a. Initially as advisers to decision makers until society becomes comfortable with AI making decisions
      without the middle man.
   b. Legal challenges. Proof of correctness when things go right. Liability when things go wrong.

8. Humans have a limitless capacity for self-deception. The system would have to be set up as a double-blind
   experiment to minimize bias. Human fatigue would have to be considered for both the interrogator and the
   actual human participant.

(9.) If my goal in life is to develop AI, then what is my role once AI exists? Improve it? Find something else to do?
